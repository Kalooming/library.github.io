This is the first post. I plan to publish:
- long essays (1,500–6,000 words)
- short notes and marginalia
- reading-series (on authors like Kant, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein)

Footnotes, inline LaTeX, and citations work. Example inline math: $\\forall x\\; P(x)$.

> If you want a reading-list or a series structure, tell me and I will scaffold it.
